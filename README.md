A Loop Hero inspired rouge-like project built in 72 hours as a part of the annual 2024 GTMK Game Jam. Circuit Central is a fast-paced, strategic roguelike that blends rouge-like and auto-battler mechanics with an innovative circuit-based inventory system. Drawing inspiration from Loop Hero, players place and connect item modules on a grid to upgrade and rewire their robot's abilities on the fly to continue fending off waves of enemies in an endless run.

# Core Systems:
Custom-Built Inventory System: Rather than traditional item slots, players arrange components on a dynamic circuit board, choosing to upgrade existing items or add new ones.

Automated Combat Loop: Your robot auto-fights as it travels, giving you time between battles to manage upgrades, adjust the circuit grid, pop random item balloons and plan your loadout for upcoming enemy waves.


# Key Features:
Circuit Grid Management: Strategically place weapons, health items, utilities, and passive modules on a limited circuit board.

Endless Replayability: Survive increasingly difficult enemy waves in a self-contained loop until you’re inevitably overwhelmed—or become unstoppable.


# Technologies & Architecture:
Unity (C#) – Custom gameplay systems;

Scriptable Objects - Used extensively to define modular item behaviors and abilities for flexible content creation.


# Current Progress & Next Steps:
Current Status:
Core loop fully functional: inventory, combat, enemy spawning, and basic progression in place.
- Nine module types implemented (Pistol, Machine Gun, Flamethrower, Base Damage Up, Damage Mulitplier, Life Regen, Item Luck Up, Max HP Up, and a secret bonus item).
- Enemy waves and enemy scaling implemented.

Next Steps:
- Polish and refactor code for post-jam release.
- Add more module types, including new special rare modules with unique effects.
- Expand enemy variety and introduce elite mini-boss encounters.
- Include wave breaks, allowing more time for item, robot and circuit modifications.
- Develop item synergies, providing a more interesting choice between adding new items and upgrading existing ones.
